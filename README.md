## Background

The inspiration and source of Wudao is the actual needs of the laboratory scientific research process. There are often data analysis tasks in the laboratory, but in the past, data analysis through programming is time-consuming and laborious. Different data sets have certain repetitive operations when processing data, such as missing completion, data normalization and other steps are common. Therefore, I thought of the hope to build such a platform, which can encapsulate many algorithms and codes used in the process of data analysis and realize them in the way of one click on the web page, so as to quickly complete various tasks in the process of data analysis.

The goal of Wudao cloud platform for data analysis based on machine learning is to provide a one click guided ability to use machine learning algorithms to scientifically analyze common types of data, visually view data and model results, analyze and obtain useful knowledge such as the association between data, for the majority of user groups who are not good at programming and are not familiar with machine learning but have data analysis needs.
